Redfin Chrome Extension

This extension was not created or endorsed by Redfin.

This Chrome extension adds some useful links to Redfin property pages.
I wrote this because I found myself visiting these sites for houses
that I was seriously interested in.  Having them a click away was very
useful for me, and by making this extension publicly available, I
might encourage Redfin to add the links to the site.  I don't intend
that everyone who visits Redfin should have to install this extension.
For this reason, I have not published a packaged CRX file of this
extension.

Right now it adds the following links:

  in the property details panel:

    a link to Walkscore for the property

  in the public data panel:

    a link to the King County, Washington, Parcel Viewer (if relevant)

    a link to the Kirkland, Washington, Permits site (if relevant)

To install this extension, download the source, go to the Extensions
page in Chrome, expand the Developer Mode panel, and click "Pack
extension..."  Specify the source directory as the extension root
directory.  You don't need to specify a private key file.
